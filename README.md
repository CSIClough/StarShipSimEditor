The workflow for the builds is available here;
https://github.com/CSIClough/StarShipSimEditor/actions

To use click on "Select Database", and navigate to the stars_custom.db and click on open.
This is usually found in the following location unless a custom location has been specified in Steam.
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Starship Simulator Dev Playtest\StarshipSimulator\Content\stars_custom.db

Clicking on the drop box against "Object Name" will show all the objects in the Celestial Objects table. 

To edit an entry select it and modify the fields as needed then click on "Save Changes"

To create a new entry either enter the fields as needed or select an existing object as a template and click on "Clone Current" then modify as required before clicking on "Save Changes"

Currently stars can only be viewed they can't be edited - this is very much WIP and may result in errors.
